# civicenia.github.io

## Installing the site

You'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [node 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/CivIcenia/civicenia.github.io.git IceniaGov`

- Change directories into the cloned repo: `cd IceniaGov`

- Install the site's dependencies: `pnpm install`

## Updating the Site

There is a script called `admin.mjs`, which you can invoke via `./admin.mjs` or `node admin.mjs`. This script will run [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) in development mode and start a [NetlifyCMS](https://v1.netlifycms.org/) proxy. You can access the NetlifyCMS dashboard by going to http://localhost:4000/admin/index.html, or by clicking the "Admin" navigation link on the site.

The NetlifyCMS dashboard is extremely helpful when entering new bills and laws, but can be cumbersome with elections. I recommend using both the dashboard and your IDE with elections since you can then copy-paste party names and colours wholesale. DO NOT REMOVE REPEALED LAWS! Just toggle the "EXPIRED" switch in the dashboard.

## Saving in the Dashboard

Once you've finished editing something in the dashboard, you should see in the top left "UNSAVED CHANGES", and to the right of that is a dropdown-button labelled "Publish". Click that and choose the "Publish now" option. This will save your changes to disk.

## Particulars

- Laws:
  - YOU NEED TO ADD THE LAW BEFORE YOU CAN POST THE BILL THAT ENACTED THE LAW!
  - Run `admin.mjs`
  - Open http://localhost:4000/admin/index.html
  - Click "Data" in the sidebar.
  - Click "Laws", this should bring up a page with all laws ordered from oldest to newest.
  - Click "Add law +"
  - Scroll down to the new form.
  - Follow the instructions.


- Bills:
  - Run `admin.mjs`
  - Open http://localhost:4000/admin/index.html
  - Click "Changes to Law" in the sidebar.
  - Click "New Change to Law"
  - For the "INSTITUTION":
    - **Senate**: if it's a Senate Bill.
    - **Executive**: if it's a decree or statutory-instrument (like Article 1 of the Hansard Act)
    - **Referendum**: if it's the result of a referendum.
    - **Signatures of Icenians**: for ratifying new constitutions.
  - For the "TITLE":
    - Passed Bills should be formatted as "Passing the Example Bill" (it should always be Bill, not Act)
    - If it's a treaty, it should be "Signing the Example Treaty"
    - If it's an Amendment, it should be "Passing the Nth Amendment to the Constitution"
    - If it's a Bill that also includes an Amendment, it should be "Passing the Example Bill (+ Nth Amendment)"
  - Short and concise Bills should be recorded in Markdown:
    - Scroll to the "HOW ARE YOU EMBEDDING THIS?" section
    - For the "TYPE", select "Markdown"
    - Write/paste the raw markdown into the "VALUE"
  - Longer Bills, or Bills that include media (like images), should be included as PDFs:
    - Export the Bill as-is to a PDF (make sure it has no header or footer clutter)
      - If it's a Google Doc:
        - Ensure that you're on the `/edit` version of the URL
        - Do `File -> Download -> PDF Document (.pdf)`
    - Generate a random UUIDv4 from https://www.uuidgenerator.net/ or `crypto.randomUUID()`
    - Rename the PDF to that UUIDv4 (eg: `648f32f8-b3cb-4cdc-98e5-8adef925ebf7.pdf`)
    - Move the PDF to `/public/archive/`
    - Scroll to the "HOW ARE YOU EMBEDDING THIS?" section.
    - For the "TYPE", select "Local File"
    - Paste your PDF's name prefixed by `/archive/` (eg: `/archive/648f32f8-b3cb-4cdc-98e5-8adef925ebf7.pdf`)


- Elections:
  - Run `admin.mjs`
  - Open http://localhost:4000/admin/index.html
  - Click "Elections" in the sidebar.
  - Click "New Election"
  - For "PARTIES":
    - You may find it infinitely easier to edit these in your IDE since you can then copy-paste parties (and their colours) straight over.
    - Put the parties in order of appearance in #campaign-announcements, with an "Independents" pseudo-party (keep the default colours), which should always be the last party.
    - ONLY INCLUDE PARTY MEMBERS THAT WERE ELECTED!


- Border Polygons:
  - Run `admin.mjs`
  - Open `/src/pages/government/borders.json.ts` in your IDE.
  - Open http://localhost:4000/government/map in your browser.
  - Ensure the "Icenian Territory" collection is toggled on.
  - Keep in mind that the `borders.json.ts` is the source of truth. If you update the polygon on the map and then refresh, it'll just revert to what the `borders.json.ts` says.
    - Updating polygons:
      - The map interface sadly has no way to export individual polygons; it'll instead export a whole feature like ALL of Bloom.
      - For the sake of guidance, let's say you've edited a Bloomean polygon.
      - In `borders.json.ts` each polygon is labelled. Did you edit Bloom proper, Cane Corp, etc?
      - For the sake of guidance, let's say you've edited the "Petrichor (City Exclave)" polygon, which is the 4th polygon, remember that.
      - Copy the exported JSON (from the map interface) into the left-side of https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print
      - You should notice the `name` and `id` values in the JSON. You've effectively got the whole block of JSON, this means you need to extract the modified polygon.
      - Keep the spacing to "2 Tab Space", then click "Make Pretty"
      - On the right side, underneath the "o" in "polygon" will be a `[`. On that line, next to the line-number, should be a triangular down-arrow. Click that.
      - That whole polygon should now be collapsed to look like `[↔],`
      - Since "Petrichor (City Exclave)" is the 4th polygon, we need to do this another 3 times.
      - The right side should now look like:
        ```json
        {
          "name": "Bloom (Icenia)",
          "id": "087ac1aa-2c98-4496-8ed7-ccbe2050c25b",
          "polygon": [
            [↔],
            [↔],
            [↔],
            [↔]
          ],
          "notes": "The Viceroyalty of Bloom became a State of Icenia on 27th June 2022. Petrichor merged into Bloom on 19th March 2023.",
          "nation": "Republic of Icenia",
          "website": "http://localhost:4000",
          "color": "#00C9FF",
          "collectionId": "civmc/icenia/territory"
        }
        ```
      - Select the 4th `[↔]` (ensure there's no `,` at the end since it's the last polygon and JSON doesn't allow trailing commas) and copy.
      - Then select the whole "Petrichor (City Exclave)" labelled polygon in `borders.json.ts` and then paste, it should now be replaced with the updated polygon, not with `[↔]`.
      - If you have a modern IDE, that line should now be tagged blue somehow to indicate an edited line.
      - Save.
      - Refresh the map.
      - The map should now have the updated polygon.
    - Adding polygons:
      - The map interface sadly has no way to add polygons to an existing feature, so we have to do this manually.
      - Draw a new polygon on the map, then paste the exported JSON into the left side of https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print
      - Follow the instructions in the relevant section of the `Updating polygons` guide until you have `[↔]` copied.
      - Paste the `[↔]` into the end of the "polygon" array of the feature (Icenia, Bloom, Icarus, etc) you want to add the polygon to.
      - Make sure the label the added polygon something obvious so that others (and your future self) knows what that polygon is.
      - Save.
      - Refresh the map.
      - The polygon should now be part of that feature, though it may be hidden beneath the original polygon you drew.


- Officials:
  - Run `admin.mjs`
  - Open `src/pages/government/officials.astro` in your IDE.
  - Use https://toolscord.com/ to get the profile-pictures of each official.
  - Use their IGN, if known. Or otherwise use their Discord name, simplified if necessary.
  - Include each position, even if obvious (eg: that the Chief Magistrate is also a Magistrate)
  - Roles should be ordered as such: executive, then legislative, then judicial.


- Publishing
  - Always do `pnpm run build` before committing and pushing.
  - The site should automatically republish itself anytime you push to master.
  - If something goes wrong on Github's end, and you need to attempt a republish, do:
    - Click the "Actions" tab above (assuming you're on this repo's Github page)
    - Click the "IceniaGov Site Build" workflow in the left sidebar.
    - Click the "Run workflow" dropdown.
    - Ensure the "Branch" dropdown has the master branch selected.
    - Click the "Run workflow" button.
    - This will manually republish the site regardless of git activity.


- Styling
  - This site uses the GOVUK template.
  - You should consult [this](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/) if you intend to add new things to the site.
  - The "Components" tab is particularly useful. All of its components have a "HTML" source option, which you can copy as-is onto the site.
