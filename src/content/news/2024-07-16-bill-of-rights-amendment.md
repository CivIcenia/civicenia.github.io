    “The Icenian Bill of Rights applies to all Icenians of the Citizen rank or
    higher. I would like just adjusted to read “The Icenian Bill of Rights
    applies to all Icenians of the Citizen rank or higher unless stated
    otherwise.”


    In this paragraph, I would also like to remove the mention of “Citizens” in the closing sentence. Instead of “These rights may be suspended as part of punishment for a crime that a citizen has been convicted of.” It would instead read “These rights may be suspended as part of punishment for a crime they have been duly convicted of.”


    I would like to replace “Citizens” with “Icenians” in section 5 of the Bill of Rights”.
