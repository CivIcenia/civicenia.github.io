headline: Passing the Le Heckin' Voter Tax Amendment

excerpt: >-
  Proposed by SpeedyJustice


  The recent election was a demonstration of why we should return back to the previous model of requiring some metric of activity to vote in the Icenian Senate Election. Canvassing is a legitimate political strategy both IRL and in Civ and encouraging members of our community to vote is important, but fishing for citizens who logged in like 2 years ago and never again to vote has shown in this election to be more similar to 2 necromancers competing on how many zombies they can raise from the dead to send a message in the voting channel than a reflection of the populations wishes for representation. To resolve this, we can implement a free way for citizens to register for our elections.
