> An act to reconcile the Hansard Act and the Federal Executives Consolidation Act regarding the Archival role
>
> **Issue:** 2 different archival roles defined in Hansard and FECA
>   Primary Differences:
>
> * the ability for the Hansard Archiver to read through archives
> * the power for the Hansard Archiver make modifications to bills for archival purposes
> * The Hansard Archiver being hired by the President
> * the FECA Archivist getting paid
> * The FECA Archivist being hired by the Senate
>
> **Solution:** 
> Bill unifies the Hansard Archiver role and the FECA Archivist role into 1 by
>
> 1. Defining Archivist employment in FECA (retaining Senate hiring procedure and job description)
> 2. Defining Archivist powers in Hansard (retaining Archiver powers required for archival maintenance) 
> 3. Retaining Presidential decision making on whether to let an Archivist into the privated archives (Archivist are still able to perform limited archival maintenance on public information)
>
> Requires 3/5 and presidental assent
