headline: Passing the Motion to bring back the Free Apartments Forum Channel
  Under Info and Onboarding

excerpt: >-
  Proposed by Doggo_Engineer


  It was removed a week ago (and before that only a few people had permission to post new apartment units in it), but I feel a place where new friends can find a list of free apartments they can take will speed up onboarding and make things easier on the SOI, by letting the new friends place themselves where they want to be. 


  Currently the SOI has to keep a seperate directory of available new friend apartments, ask around to find available apartments, or remember all of the ones that are available. This channel should be free for everyone residents+ to post free apartments in, and not necessarily just in Icenia City either.
