    Orinnari is interested in acquiring some land from us to form a micronation,
    specifically [this
    area](https://civmc-map.github.io/#feature=%7B"name":"Wesbury","id":"9dced9a5-aefe-41f5-bdc8-cd75688f344d","polygon":"\(\(\(-5320,-3833!-5354,-3870!-5316,-3921!-5240,-3955!-5170,-3915!-5219,-3843!-5279,-3818\)\)\)"%7D). 


    I am personally in favor as I think more people playing in the -,- is generally a good thing.


    The only two conditions I would like to impose are:


    1. If Orin's nation goes completely inactive or implodes, Icenia gets the land back.


    2. Orin's nation won't join any of the alliance blocs that Icenia isn't already a member of (no LOTUS, no whatever the IF-Salerno, Groveheart alliance is, ect.)


    ---


    **Orinnari:** May I ask with the second point. Let's say, for example, that my nation joins the MDSC, which would be allowed under this rule because Icenia is a part of it. But Icenia has also been considering leaving / reforming the MDSC since it's pretty defunct, last I heard. So let's say that my nation joins the MDSC, but Icenia chooses to leave sometime after. Will my nation then be obligated to leave the MDSC as to not be in an alliance that Icenia isn't also in?


    **Quanton Biscuit:** No, it would be okay if you wanted to stay in that alliance after we left.


    **Orinnari:** Good to hear, though it sounds like your answer is only for the MDSC. I suppose I would just like a stipulation that, if my nation joins a permitted alliance, then Icenia leaves that alliance, that you let me know whether it's an alliance you'd prefer my nation leave too.


    **Quanton Biscuit:** Sure


    ---


    **Schedule 1:** Amend the Statute of Territory to declaim the following polygon: `[[-5320,-3833],[-5354,-3870],[-5316,-3921],[-5240,-3955],[-5170,-3915],[-5219,-3843],[-5279,-3818]]`


    **Schedule 2:** Enact the following as the Treaty of Wesbury:


    > # Treaty of Wesbury

    > 

    > The Third Republic of Icenia (hitherto referred to as Icenia) agrees to cede territory to the Kingdom of Wesbury (hitherto referred to as Wesbury) with the following conditions:

    > 

    > 1. Should Wesbury go inactive or implode, Icenia reserves the right to reclaim the territory.

    > 

    > 2. Wesbury shall not be permitted to join any alliance that Icenia is not itself a member of.

    > 

    >    A. Should Wesbury join a permitted alliance, Wesbury shall not be expected to follow an Icenian withdrawal from that alliance unless formally asked.
