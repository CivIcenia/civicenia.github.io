    Schedule 1: Define "Icenia City" as the following polygon: 

    https://civmc-map.github.io/#feature=%7B"name":"Icenia%20City","id":"a0052631-f3c4-4b2b-89cf-1ff1ac9ef1b2","polygon":"(((-3562,-4494!-3552,-4614!-3576,-4676!-3596,-4722!-3707,-4812!-3749,-4863!-3809,-4778!-3848,-4817!-3866,-4868!-4081,-4859!-4268,-4756!-4424,-4542!-4302,-4196!-4004,-4014!-3764,-4038!-3360,-4348)))"%7D


    Schedule 2: Allow the Secretary of the Interior to legally modify the "Icenia City" polygon to fit the working area of "Icenia City"


    Schedule 3: Label "Icenia City" on the Statue of Territory via the above definition


    Schedule 4: Amend Articles 5 and 6 of the Building Regulations and Subsidies Act to apply only within Icenia City unless given explicit approval by the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary of the Interior respectively.


    Specifically by adding requirement 6:

    > The building must operate within the bounds of Icenia City, unless approval is given by the Secretary of Treasury

    to Article 5


    and by adding point 4:

    > The property must operate within the bounds of Icenia City, unless approval is given by the Secretary of the Interior

    To Section A


    Reasoning:

    Regardless of how various discussions on the fate of building regulations in Icenia City resolve, its becoming clear that there are a variety of plans for the mainland. Even our current building and subsidy codes operate with the unspoken rule that they apply to the mainland, without any way of accurately defining that land to anyone who isn't already familiar with our policies.


    For the future, it is important that we are able to accurately divide "Icenia" from "Icenia City"
