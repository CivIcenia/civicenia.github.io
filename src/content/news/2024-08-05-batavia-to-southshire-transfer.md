    Batavia can be said to be Southshire’s first neighbor in this iteration. We
    were on good terms for much of the early iteration. Unfortunately, they and
    us (Southshire) went inactive and their lands came under control of the
    nasty Lambeau Kkkolonizers. 


    During this period of inactivity in old Batavia, many buildings were damaged, the farm was hit hard by Lambeau’s failed attempt to make a vault in the region as a fuck you to us. I (Gentle__Giant) seek to have Southshire gain jurisdiction of these circled areas in the name of historical preservation of my oldest neighbors.
