    This Bill would amend the Statute of Territory to correct our borders around
    the following to this:

    ```

    [[-3225,-2403],[-3225,-2371],[-3165,-2338],[-3150,-2361],[-3135,-2375],[-3089,-2360],[-3089,-2245],[-2957,-2245],[-2936,-2218],[-2926,-2198],[-2918,-2163],[-2847,-2166],[-2789,-2239],[-2762,-2248],[-2749,-2264],[-2689,-2304],[-2627,-2280],[-2603,-2309],[-2599,-2374],[-2562,-2424],[-2688,-2687],[-2713,-2703],[-2743,-2708],[-2777,-2730],[-2843,-2730],[-2870,-2753],[-2879,-2785],[-2931,-2760],[-3024,-2753],[-3046,-2724],[-3088,-2695],[-3122,-2625],[-3170,-2630],[-3208,-2609],[-3214,-2586],[-3222,-2562],[-3200,-2500],[-3194,-2449]]

    ```


    Which would fix the claims overlap (see the top of the polygon which encapsulates the yellowish area), which was a mistake as it was agreed that area would be given to Columbia.
