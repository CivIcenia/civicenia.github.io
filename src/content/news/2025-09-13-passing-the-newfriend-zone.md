excerpt: >-
  It doesn't seem like it's a particularly controversial bill and it's mostly
  rubberstamping and putting in law what already exists, while giving more
  flexibility to the SOI to derelict things faster and more easily if needed.
  It's also been almost 24H.


  Proposed by Senator Zhirall
