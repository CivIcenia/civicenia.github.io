    I propose that the quoted bit (Disqualification of Candidates) below be
    added to the constitution under the elections section. I think campaign
    eligibility for dual citizens should be handled on a case by case basis as I
    think trying to legislate exactly what conditions each candidate is able to
    run under is impractical. This would fix the issue of dual citizens who have
    concerning foreign attachments being eligible to run. I think this fix makes
    it disqualifying candidates something that can't be done lightly and
    outlines a simple process that is easy to follow. 


    > **Disqualification of Candidates:** A candidate may be disqualified from the election if the President, Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Interior agree. The candidate must be notified of being disqualified before the opening of the polls for the disqualification to be valid.
