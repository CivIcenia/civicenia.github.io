    I am proposing the following amendments to the Building Regulations and
    Subsidies Act in order to make enforcement of SOI build approval more
    streamlined so unapproved builds may be demolished faster, and to codify the
    property registry into law.


    Change the Non-Ex Post Facto to say: 

    > Articles 1 and 2 shall not apply retroactively to builds within Icenia built prior to the 10th March 2023. Article 4, Section 1 shall not apply retroactively to builds within Icenia built prior to the 27th January 2024.


    Rewrite Article 4 as:

    > Article 4:  

    > (1) All civilian builds must first receive permission from the proper authority (Secretary of the Interior unless otherwise devolved to a more local authority). Similarly, all military builds must first receive permission from the Secretary of Defense or the relevant devolved authority with oversight from the Secretary of Defense. Any builds that were constructed without permission, nor have been given retroactive approval, may be demolished at any time without warning or compensation.

    > 

    > (3) Unless originally defined by the property owner and approved by the proper authority, newly formed properties shall be assumed to have Y-level bounds from Y=16 to sky limit, excluding any intersections that may be formed as a result of other already existing properties that occupy some or all of the same X and Z bounds of the new property.

    > 

    > (4) If a new property is not given strict bounds for the X and Z coordinates, the property should be assumed to not cross into public works such as roads, rails, etc. . If there exist two or more parties with neighboring properties, both without strict bounds for their X and Z coordinates, the parties must first attempt to come to an agreement on the dividing line/shape of their properties if there is a disagreement or accusation of encroachment. If the parties cannot come to an agreement, the proper authority may decide the limits.

    > 

    > (3) The Secretary of the Interior must maintain a publicly available, accurate, and up-to-date record with an entry for every building and/or property within Icenia City. If one or more buildings are completely contained by a single property, only the property encompassing the build(s) is required to have an entry. Each entry shall include at least: the owner's name, the approval status, a picture of the build/property, and the bounding coordinates. Bounding coordinates must unambiguously define the coordinates enclosing the build/property at least the X and Z coordinates, but preferably in the X, Y, and Z directions. Examples include 2 corner coordinates of a rectangular prism shaped properties, or all vertex coordinates of a polyhedron shaped property.

    > 

    > (4) The Secretary of Defense must maintain an accurate and up-to-date record with an entry for every military build within Icenia. The Secretary of Defense may decide who can access the record. Each entry shall include at least the bounding coordinates. Bounding coordinates for a build are explained in the previous section.
