[Passed by the October 2025 Senate](https://discord.com/channels/558071874161082368/1402070228418170911)

This bill was first passed by the August 2025 Senate, but the President failed to respond to the proposal. The bill was subsequently revoted on in October, and the President gave his assent within a few hours after the bill was passed by the October 2025 Senate.
