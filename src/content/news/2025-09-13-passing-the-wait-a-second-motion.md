    Icenia “Wait a Second” Act

    1) For the May 2025 Senate Elections, the election may be held off for five days by presidential

    order to allow for the Icenian Senate to discuss sweeping potential amendments to the

    Constitution regarding the citizenship structure of Icenia and Senate elections.

    2) This means that by Thursday, May 1st, the Senate will have a vote cast and decided on the

    “Citizens Bill of 2025” and potential candidates will get three days to announce and campaign

    for Senate, with the election taking place on the 4th of May.

    3) In the interim, the April Senate will continue to be seated and able to vote during that time.
