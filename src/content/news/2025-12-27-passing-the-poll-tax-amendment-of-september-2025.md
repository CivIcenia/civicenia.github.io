    This will replace sections (i) and (ii)



    Poll tax: Eligible citizens shall be granted registered-voter status for the next calendar month after the payment of a poll tax - five days of passive Player Essence generation - to the government in a readily verifiable way:


    (i)    Eligibility: Before the end of voting for the month’s election, a citizen must register to vote by depositing player essence at a polling location.


    (ii)    Polling locations: Polling locations will be created in each center of population in Icenia. Each polling location will be managed by a State Representative, Senator, or Secretary. Officials managing polling locations may delegate election poll workers to operate the location.


    (iii)    Polling location construction: Item exchange for the specified amount of essence in a secure, readily accessible location. Place a Juke with no immunity in a location in range of the item exchange. This juke should be out of range of any other item exchanges, regular foot traffic, and breaking and placing blocks.


    (iv)    Polling location operation: Before the election is certified, logs and player essence must be presented in an audit channel. Logs can be generated by first doing the command in-game /jainfo [page] action=break, and /jainfo [page] action=place and screenshot and post in the audit channel. If any break or place actions are present for that month, the election poll worker must then do /ja and screenshot and post the place and break actions in the audit channel. The election poll worker will then do /jainfo [page] action=itemexchange and will screenshot and post all the results for that month into the audit channel. The essence will then be compared to the registered voters for that polling station


    (v) The Secretary of the Interior, or other authorized person, is expected to verify poll-tax payments within a reasonable period, and maintain a publicly available database of voter registrations and their expiration dates.
