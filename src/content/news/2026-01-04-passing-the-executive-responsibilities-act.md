    Append IV. Government

    (i) Executive Roles

    Executive roles may be created and dissolved by the Senate via a simple majority vote requiring Presidential assent. 



    A motion creating an executive role must specify the list of tasks and responsibilities that are to be assigned to that role. 

    The assignment of tasks and responsibilities to an executive role in no way alienates the powers of any other office enumerated in this Constitution.


    Every executive role must be placed under the purview of a Secretary. That Secretary is responsible for appointing and dismissing any number of individuals to serve in that executive role.

    Holding other government positions in Icenia, including other executive roles, does not prohibit an individual from holding an executive role.


    A channel or set of channels must be provided where Secretaries can communicate with their executives.
