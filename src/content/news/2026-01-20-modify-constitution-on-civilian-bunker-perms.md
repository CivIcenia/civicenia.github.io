    AUTOMATICALLY SCRAPED CONTENT:
    
    Modify II. Citizenship in the following manner:
    
    Insert the **__Bolded and Underlined Text__** into the following excerpts:
    
    > (c) Patrician
    > Rights: Eligible to own a medium sized bunker (the bunker must be approved by the Secretary of Interior **__and the Secretary of Defense__** prior to construction).
    
    > (d) Equestrian
    > Rights: Eligible to own a large bunker or skybunker (the bunker must be approved by the Secretary of Interior **__and the Secretary of Defense__**  prior to construction).
    
    Reason is that the <@&986304359266680882>  doesn't have enough knowledge to approve of such requests related to defensive infra (<@&986304201997033482>  would have enough knowledge to approve from a defensive/miliitary standpoint)
    The <@&986304359266680882> is retained to ensure that the bunkers don't interfere with land or property of other citizens.
    
    Requires Enhanced Vote of 4/5 and Presidential Assent
