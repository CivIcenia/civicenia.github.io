    AUTOMATICALLY SCRAPED CONTENT:
    
    In addition to other requirements listed in the constitution, citizens who wish to become a patrician and be eligible to run for government must pass a series of questions related to Icenia and the server mechanics. In order to fulfill another requirement of running for government, being able to use voice chat, this test should be (but not required to be) done over voice chat.
    
     - Any member of government, or a knowledgable Icenian appointed by the government, will be able to conduct the test. 
    
    - Consuls of Icenia shall create a bank of questions and for the members of government to choose from. 
    
    - These questions should include topics ranging from: basic server plugins (how to use factories, how to reinforce), Icenian government structure (duties of senators and secretaries, Icenian states), prominent Icenian locations (Wholefoods, Derne, Blue cove, Sarlacc pit,  Montefiore), Icenian international relations (WARDA, DGP), Icenian history (past wars, alliances, major events), or any other questions with readily available answers which can be found on the civwiki, Icenia website, or Icenia discord.
    
    - This test should not be conducted as a straight point based system with a pass/fail grade. It should be more similar to an interview/conversation over these topics.
    
    - Testers shall submit a summary of the interview given to the government for review and final approval before promoting the citizen to Patrician.
