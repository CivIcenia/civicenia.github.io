    Amend to


    > Senate elections (aka “General Elections”) will begin at the start of each calendar month, or shortly thereafter. The voting period will begin with an announcement from the President or the Speaker of the Senate, whichever is first, which must list the lawful candidates and the rules of the election. The voting period will conclude exactly 24 hours after the announcement. Any votes cast or recast after that time will be disregarded.


    Clarifies that senate elections aren't hard-tied to the start of the month, clarifies that any gov official may open voting since thats how it has traditionally run, clarifies that voting concludes 24 hours after the starting message to avoid confusion.
