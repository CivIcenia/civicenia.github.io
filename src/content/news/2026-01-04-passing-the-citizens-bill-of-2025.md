TL:DR of bill

* Allows citizens to run for Senate with certain additional requirements 

* Allows citizenship/tiers of citizenship to be granted off of time spent in Icenia—not just public works projects 

* Allows the President/Secretary of Defense to suspend citizenship for up to 2 weeks during a state of emergency (already functionally a thing, it just codifies it) 

* Changes patrician requirements for approval to be between any two of the Secretary of Defense, Minister of Interior, and President rather than all three.
