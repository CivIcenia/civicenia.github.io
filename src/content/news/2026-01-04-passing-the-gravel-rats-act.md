> As quoted from LopsterBisque
>
> > I believe that Icenia stands to benefit from having an official military organization of non PVPers who are prepared ahead of time to assist in non-combat and light-combat roles in the event of war, primarily producing and transporting materials.
>
> This act was written as an adaptation of Lopster's idea, with the goal of establishing the "Gravel Rats" as a dedicated logistical military entity within the nation of Icenia. Their primary mission is non-combat and light-combat support, focusing on the production, transportation, and preparation of strategic materials.
