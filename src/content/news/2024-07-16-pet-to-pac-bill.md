    This Bill seeks to give the city of Petrichor and immediate surrounding
    territory to the nation of Pacem on the basis of: 


    1. Connecting to their island exclave 

    2. The preservation and growth of the city of Petrichor. 


    We have checked with Sirboss and Bloom and both are okay with this.


    The polygon of this territory is: `[[-6035,-2316],[-5877,-2379],[-5843,-2352],[-5808,-2336],[-5723,-2248],[-5723,-2196],[-5761,-2151],[-5764,-1984],[-5840,-1844],[-5884,-1858],[-5909,-1895],[-5936,-1924],[-5984,-1929],[-5983,-2168],[-5992,-2227],[-6015,-2256],[-6030,-2291]]`
