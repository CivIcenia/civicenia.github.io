    Should the Bill receive majority approval (>50%) and receive Presidential
    Assent, it passes and, if applicable, becomes law. Bills that do not require
    Presidential Assent should be referred to as “Motions”.

    Any senator may choose to call an override vote, requiring an 85% in favor, to approve a bill absent presidential assent. An override vote cannot be applied to a constitutional amendment. An override vote may also be used to close voting on a bill or motion absent assent from the Speaker of the Senate.
