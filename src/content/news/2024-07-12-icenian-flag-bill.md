    ## DESIGN


    The flag of Icenia is to follow the construction sheet in the attached image and flown vertically by rotating ninety degrees clockwise.


    Figure one represents the flag of Icenia after this bill is passed, it is a two-to-one ratio white field with a light blue dot one quarter of the height of the flag.

    Figure two is the construction sheet of the flag of Icenia, displaying all of the required information to recreate it.

    Figure three shows the vexillogical symbols to indicate the characteristics of the flag of Icenia, from left to right; this is the observe side of the flag, the flag's reverse side is identical to its observe side, and the flag's vertical state is a rotation of the orignal.
