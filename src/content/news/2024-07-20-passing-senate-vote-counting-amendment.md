  value: >-
    Be it enacted by the Presidentâ€™s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the
    advice and consent of the Speaker and Senators of this present Senate
    assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-


    **Schedule 1:** Amend Article IV (a) of the Constitution to append the following:


    > Senate votes shall only attain their required majority when counted against all non-abstained seats; absences shall not count as abstentions.

    The Senate has largely been operating on this principle already, as the Speaker (as well as other officials and interested persons) ping the Senate or the particular Senators who've yet to cast their vote. But there *is* some level of ambiguity. If a Senator were to sponsor a Bill, and they vote Aye on it, but no other Senator votes on it, and the Speaker concludes the vote after 24 hours... does it pass or fail? It received 100% support from those who voted, but only received 1 Aye out of 7 (in this present Senate) seats. What this Amendment would do is count the votes against the total seats in the Senate, so for a Senate Motion to pass, it must attain >50% of seats, not >50% of votes. Senators may still actively abstain, which effectively reduces the amount of seats *for that vote*, but absences are not considered abstentions. Not being able to get the Senate's attention for something doesn't mean it should pass by default.
