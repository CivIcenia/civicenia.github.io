    Any government official may call for a vote of the senate to ban a player from Icenian territory. A territory ban can be instituted or revoked following a simple majority vote, and can be vetoed or repealed by the President, the Speaker of the Senate, or the Secretary of Defense. 


    A successful territory ban must be communicated to the player banned, or their host nation. Once communicated, it designates the player an Active Threat while in Icenian borders, who can be pearled and sentenced for entering.


    A territory ban does not apply to publicly accessible rails or rail stations unless specified, but this privilege can be revoked by a government official.
