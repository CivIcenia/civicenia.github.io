    1. In the constitution, substitute section VII(b), subheader Dereliction
    with:

        Dereliction: Any private property may be derelicted through the following process:

        1. A citizen must place a sign in clear view on the property, or as close as reasonably possible, an unreinforced sign containing the word "Dereliction", and the current date.
        2. The citizen performing the dereliction states that they are derelicting the property in the Icenian discord.
    The Secretary of the Interior must then approve the dereliction.
        3. The dereliction may be denied by the property owner by removing the sign on the property or responding in the discord.
        4. The dereliction must be accepted by the Secretary of Interior.
        5. The Secretary of Interior may state in their acceptance of the dereliction that the property will be transferred to the government, in which case the property shall be transferred to the government upon completion of the dereliction.
        6. If the dereliction is not denied for 7 days, and accepted by the Secretary of Interior within 14 days, the dereliction is completed.
        7. Notwithstanding section 5, the property shall be transferred to the citizen performing the dereliction upon completion of the dereliction.

    2. Furthermore, the Secretary of Interior may retroactively approve previous derelictions that meet these conditions.
