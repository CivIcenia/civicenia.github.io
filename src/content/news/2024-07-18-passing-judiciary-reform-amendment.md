    “Currently, it is within the power and responsibility of the senate to swear
    in new magistrates to the magistrates bench. The law currently states that "
    The Bench shall consist of at least four Icenians whose citizenship rank is
    “Citizen” or higher, appointed by the Senate. Magistrates are appointed by a
    simple majority vote from the Senate and serve for life, until resignation
    or dismissal by the senate.". I would request this be changed to "The Bench
    shall consist of at least four Icenians whose citizenship rank is “Citizen”
    or higher, appointed by the Chief Magistrate approved by the president.
    Magistrates serve for life, until resignation or a 2/3rds majority vote to
    remove them via the senate."


    I would also wish to remove the chief magistrates role in making the decision to extradite pearls, as this is a political decision and not a judicial one. The law currently states "Pearls may from time to time be extradited to a foreign entity or exempted from trial upon the agreement of the President, Speaker of the Senate, and the Chief Magistrate." I would like this to be changed to " Pearls may from time to time be extradited to a foreign entity or exempted from trial upon the agreement of the President, Secretary of Defense, and the Speaker of the Senate".
