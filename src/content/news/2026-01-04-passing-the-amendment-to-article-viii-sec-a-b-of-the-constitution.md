    States are permitted to govern and manage the following limited subjects within their borders: building codes, permits, zoning, and derelictions of non-federally owned properties; non-military public transportation (roads, rails, canals, etc); industrial facilities (farms, factories, wealth storage, etc); taxes; and public holidays.


    States are also permitted to establish their own judicial systems to adjudicate local issues, enforcing any rulings within their borders through whatever means they are legally capable of.
