The November 2025 Senate Elections was the first senate election to employ Yodabird's STV system. 

The original order of senators elected were: \
shadno, anvil, yodabird19, zolo17, creepilycreep, 7misun, 1kayotic

7misun originally won the 6th seat, but decided to announce their resignment right after entering office.

STV was used to recalculate the election assuming 7misun's absence, resulting in the following order:\
shadno, anvil, 1kayotic, zolo17, yodabird19, creepilycreep, raeders
