The Senate Election returned with the following results:

- Gjum: 18
- Slushhi: 16
- Xcios: 15
- Sirboss: 12
- Anvil: 11

There was a three-way tie for the two remaining seats, so a runoff election was held, resulting in:
- Rinvincibl3: 16
- MrJeremyFisher: 14

Rinvincibl3 then disbanded his 'RPTRHSHCPMA' Party, resuming his Senatorship as an independent.
