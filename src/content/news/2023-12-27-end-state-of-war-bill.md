    Although we still have to deal with the aftermaths, the war is over and we
    do not longer have a need to invoke any of the clauses in the Articles of
    War. 


    By passing this Bill we:


    1. End State of War


    2. Exclude the pearls obtained in the war from the usual requirement of Article V (d) of the Constitution, giving the Secretary of Defense the right to sentence the pearls and further hold them on behalf of our allies after their sentences expire.
