    Gang Shi has repeatedly shown itself to be a hostile and antagonistic group
    that has ill intentions. Allowing the bulk of their citizens to remain in
    our discord will do nothing but cause further drama and strife. They do not
    add much if anything to our dialogue and have no economic reason to be in
    our discord.


    I propose that the following Gang Shi Citizens and known associates be banned from Icenia Discord effective immediately. This ban will last two months, once the ban length has expired, the Senate will have the opportunity to renew or annul the ban.
