    1) Due to the overall increase in activity within Icenia, the positive
    recruitment of new members of Icenia, and the passage of the “poll tax
    amendment of April 2025,” anyone with the “citizen” role may vote in the May
    2025 Senate Election, regardless of poll tax payment.


    2) This allowance will continue until the next “poll tax” is announced by the Secretary of the Interior.


    3) Anyone who has donated essence for the May 2025 election under the previous “poll tax” will receive just compensation in iron or diamond for the donated essence, to be determined by the Secretary of Defense and in line with the market rate for essence.
