    Add the following article to the Articles of War:


    > **Article 0:** These Articles of War shall be considered on-par with the Constitution and thus shall be bound to the same Amendment process defined in Article IX of the Constitution.


    This is just something I realised may be necessary. The Articles of War are an ordinary statute but override the Constitution in... basically all places. I figure stating in the law itself that it's on the same level as the Constitution, even though it's not *in* the Constitution, is a good idea.
