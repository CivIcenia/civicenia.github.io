[Passed by the December 2025 Senate](https://discord.com/channels/558071874161082368/1457387364996349973)

TLDR: Removes the requirement of the coat of arms being on all legislation, and cleaning up the 3rd clause.

Reasoning is that this clause invalidates a crap ton if not all official documents created after 8 Sep 2025 depending on interpretation, not just codified legislation. The use of the coat of arms should be defined within hansard as an archival standard on legal codes instead.

See the below for details (repeals are **~~bolded and struck through~~**):
