    Suspend their terms, but we can skip a replacement vote as it's almost next
    month anyway. Sends a clear message. 


    We are voting on a motion that includes:


    - Forged be removed as Secretary of the Interior, with no replacement until after the election.

    - JuniorTide be removed as a Magistrate and as a Senator without triggering a by-election.

    - Forged, JuniorTide, and Xcios will be disqualified from holding public and/or military office until their respective bans have expired.
