    As a temporary arrangement that legitimizes the City Council's governance
    over the city, the following is to be published as a Resolution: 


    **WHEREAS,** the Constitution grants certain powers to the Secretary of the Interior (SOI), including but not limited to: approving developments, zoning regulations, building codes, public works projects, and public transportation;


    **WHEREAS,** the City Council is empowered to govern within Icenia City by the Icenia City Council Act;


    **WHEREAS,** the Constitution does *not* preclude the powers of the SOI from being legally delegated to a municipal government, as it was by the Icenia City Council Act, nor does it grant these powers *exclusively* to the SOI;


    **NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,** that the Icenia City Council interprets this to mean that all local governance within city limits, including the aforementioned powers of the SOI, now fall under the Council’s jurisdiction; and


    **BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED,** that the SOI retains authority outside the city limits and may act within them only as delegated or approved by the Council. For projects extending beyond the city limits, such as a railway which begins within city limits and ends outside city limits, approval must be granted by both the SOI and the Council.
