    *Amend the City Charter to included the* **`formatted text`****:


    The Icenia City Council may consider four types of legislative acts:

    Ordinances - laws which are binding within Icenia City limits;

    Resolutions - statements of opinion and other **`formal non-binary`** decisions of the City Council

    Charter amendments - acts of the Council amending this City Charter.

    **`Decisions - formal votes resolving a specific question or proposal, wherein both “yes” and “no” votes express the Council’s position, recording the Council’s resolved stance on requiring binary determination, such as appointments, interpretations, or procedural motions. A Decision may fail if more than fifty percent (>50%) of city councillors abstain.`**

> This is to resolve the failure of resolutions having interpretive ambiguity on whether the decision is “NO” or “NO POSITION”
>
> Decisions would be used for stuff requiring binary interpretation, such as procedural motions (whether to have by-elections), and maybe interpretation of ambiguous laws, or whatever needs a clear stance.
>
> Also this would turn 01-05 into a decision, removing the ambiguity
