headline: Passing the Citizenship Suspension Bill

    Citizenship may be temporarily suspended by order of the President, Speaker
    of the Senate, or Secretary of Defense following an alleged crime with
    imminent prosecution, if it is believed that the possession of citizenship
    poses a risk to informational or national security. 


    - A temporary suspension does not strip a citizen of protections in the bill of rights, besides allowing for discord roles and ingame groups to be removed for its duration. 


    - A temporary suspension must be limited in scope to either the duration of the trial, or expanded following a guilty verdict upon the advice of the presiding magistrate.


    - A temporary suspension should be communicated to the recipient as soon as possible after it is put into effect, and documented in the relevant trial channel when the trial pertaining to the case opens.


    - To expand a temporary recovation to a full removal of citizenship, normal procedure must be followed.


    Reasoning:

    Oftentimes prior to a trial it is advisable to temporarily remove someones citizenship for security concerns, but a full removal poses unfortunate implications for the rights of the citizen, who now technically loses many constitutional protections. This creates a security incentive that directly contradicts the goals of the constitution, and should be patched with a more stable solution.
